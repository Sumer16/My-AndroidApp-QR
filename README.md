# My-AndroidApp-QR
This Android Application allows you to make a scanner for scanning QR Codes and upload them directly onto your Google Sheets via Google AppScript.

Import all the files into Android Studio except qr.js and Format for the Sheets.xsl, make changes to the packages that are named as dell(It is my user name on Android Studio).

Copy the code of qr.gs onto Google AppScript and then Deploy it as a Web App. Accept all the Security Options because it is going to be used by the User only and not as a Product. The generated URL for the AppScript should be included in your MainActivity.java file. 

Create your own Excel Sheet on Google Sheets and paste the URL of Google Sheets into your Google AppScript(Mentioned in the Code). Format for Google Sheets.xsl gives you an idea about the format.

If you want to make changes in variables of any file just make sure they match each of the other files including qr.gs and MainActivity.java.

It is made on API 25. If you need any help regarding this project just contact me.

This project is made from a Tutorial and needs to be changed while making their own, do not copy the exact same thing. This is just for reference. Thank You!!
